# sqrt-aprox

__*Abstract*__: The coding focus is a implementation in C of heuristics solutions using p-series to evaluate _f(x) = sqrt(x)_. All this is for a college engineer project.


## Some series to inspiring the code (series to do that aproximation)

![Series](series.png)


In order the series:
  * _(I)_ My own serie whose i found with my hands before an odd notice... (was not necessary)
  * _(II)_ The serie than Prof. Sávio give us and Gabriel it's not a her fan [*1*]
  * _(III)_ The second serie aproximation we see in platform of mathematics [wolfram](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt%28x%29) ! [*2*]

##  Observations
  * Here is a documentation about of rising factorial, whose the notation of *Pochhammer* for denotate in serie (II) and (III): [*Pochhammer Symbol*](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PochhammerSymbol.html)
    1. (II)  [*Falling Factorial*](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RisingFactorial.html)
    2. (III) [*Rising Factorial*](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FallingFactorial.html)

## History

We have a problem with the diverge output results of input values __**n** > 2__. It's frustating. For it, the focus of the problem will be to restrict the input a fix value _**z** = 50_ and after that transform it in: _**z**^(1/2) -> **k**(1 + **x**)^(1/2)_. In other words, we need factoring _√50 -> 5√2!_ some things were made in Python for prototype the solution, but the implementation mission is in C ANSI!

## Roadmap:
  - [X] Struct of algorithm and basic ideas to implement
  - [X] Construct the function in C to return the form square root factored 
  - [X] Implementation of a serie convenient (i did implement three!)
  - [X] Test series of your convergence in an input (the prototype of tests was made)
  - [X] Do the tests that our **beloved** professor wants (error estimative)
  - [ ] Discover the bug-enigma in implementation on C of the three series divergence.
    - [ ] Fix the (I) serie implementation -> *man_serie()*
    - [X] Fix the (II) serie implementation -> *sav_serie()*
    - [X] Fix the (III) serie implementation -> *wolf_serie()*
  - [ ] Fix all the divergence of the series in implementation!
