# sqrt-aprox

The coding focus is a implementation in C of heuristic solution using p-series to evaluate f(x) = sqrt(x). All this is for a college engineer project.


## Some series to inspiring the code (series to do that aproximation)

![Series](series.png)


In order:
  * _(I)_ My own serie whose i found with my hands before an odd notice... (was not necessary) (Manoel Spoke)
  * _(II)_ The serie than Prof. Sávio give us and Gabriel it's not a her fan
  * _(III)_ The second serie aproximation we see in [Wolfram](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt%28x%29)

## History

We have a problem with the diverge output results of input values *n > 2*. It's frustating. For it, the focus of the problem will be to restrict the input a fix value (z = 50) and after that transform it in: z -> *k(1 + x)^(1/2)*. In other words, we need factoring sqrt(50) -> 5*sqrt(2)! Some things were made in Python for prototype the solution, but the implementation mission is in C ANSI!

## Roadmap:
  - [X] Struct of algorithm and basic ideas to implement
  - [ ] Construct the function in C to return the form square root factored 
  - [ ] Implementation of a serie convenient
  - [ ] Test series of your convergence in an input
  - [ ] Do the tests that our **beloved** professor wants (error estimative)
