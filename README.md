# sqrt-aprox

__*Abstract*__: The coding focus is a implementation in C of heuristics solutions using p-series to evaluate _f(x) = sqrt(x)_. All this is for a college engineer project.


## Some series to inspiring the code (series to do this approximation)

![Series](series.png)


In order the series:

* _(I)_ The series than Prof. Sávio give us and Gabriel it's not a her fan [*1*] 
* _(II)_ My own series whose i found with my hands before an odd notice... (would not necessary)
* _(III)_ The second series approximation we see in platform of mathematics [wolfram](http://www.wolframalpha.com/share/clip?f=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427ek7hsa4aeht) ! [*2*]

##  Observations

* Here is a documentation about of rising factorial, whose the notation of *Pochhammer* for denote in series (I) and (III): [*Pochhammer Symbol*](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PochhammerSymbol.html)

## History

We have a problem with the diverge output results of input values __**n** > 2__. It's frustrating. For it, the focus of the problem will be to restrict the input a fix value _**z** = 50_ and after that transform it in: _**z**^(1/2) -> **k**(1 + **x**)^(1/2)_. In other words, we need factoring _√50 -> 5√2_! some things were made in Python for prototype the solution, but the implementation mission is in C ANSI!

## Roadmap

- [X] Structure of algorithm and basic ideas to implement
- [X] Construct the function in C to return the form square root factored 
- [X] Implementation of a series convenient (i did implement three!)
- [X] Test series of your convergence in an input (the prototype of tests was made)
- [X] Do the tests that our **beloved** professor wants (error estimative)
- [X] Discover the bug-enigma in implementation on C of the three series divergence.
  - [X] Fix the (I) series implementation -> *man_serie()*
  - [X] Fix the (II) series implementation -> *sav_serie()*
  - [X] Fix the (III) series implementation -> *wolf_serie()*
- [X] Fix all the divergence of the series in implementation!
